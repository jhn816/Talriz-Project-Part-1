GIT things to know
Before starting a new branch make sure the new branch is branched from dev
and to git fetch and git pull any new changes.
ex. Go to dev then (git fetch origin dev -> git checkout <YOUR BRANCH> -> git merge origin/dev -> handle all conflicts then git add . -> git commit -m "Message") 
If you need to push your branch into dev then.
ex. Go to dev then (git pull origin dev, git merge <YOUR BRANCH> , Fix any conflicts and be sure to do git add and git commit and push)

It will let you know if there are any issues with merging or pulling. You have to find where the issue is


To start the server locally go to the talriz directory,
then run command , python manage.py runserver
